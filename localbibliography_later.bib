abstract = {The role of reading in translation is rarely discussed in the literature. Translation has mainly been discussed within a product-oriented framework. The more process-oriented approaches of recent years have taken notice of reading as a component activity of the translation process. However, few empirical studies have been completed which address the role of reading in translation. The way a person reads, and the result of that reading (some sort of mental representation of the text or text segment), will depend on the reader's purposes and motivations. The present empirical study indicates that while the translator's reading of a text may be to some extent more thorough and deliberate than that of an ordinary reader, it is not likely to be markedly so. The study also indicates a significant variability in the way translators "read for translation". This suggests the existence of alternate strategies in this kind of reading.},

abstract = {This chapter describes the applicability of the eye-tracking method in studying global text processing. Eye tracking is used to study basic reading processes and syntactic parsing, but there are few studies where eye tracking is employed to examine global text processing. As one moves from the study of lexical processing to syntactic processing, the potential units of analysis increase in both number and size. There are four relevant levels of processing in the study of syntactic processing: (1) the word at which a parsing choice is expected to be made or a syntactic ambiguity to reveal itself, (2) the phrase, (3) the clause, and (4) the whole sentence. Related to the increase in the number and size of potentially interesting units of analysis, the mental processing associated with syntactic processes is more complex and varied than the mental processing associated with lexical processing. Thus, syntactic effects on eye movements are correspondingly more complex than lexical effects on eye movements.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that word processing in bilinguals is language nonselective. However, this has mostly been shown in contexts involving deliberate processing focusing on a particular aspect of linguistic information (e.g., lexicality, semantic category, relatedness). It is therefore unknown to what extent non-target language access is only apparent in overt language processing contexts. Here, we examined the effect of involuntary word processing in bilingual individuals performing a nonverbal judgment task on shapes. Chinese-English bilinguals had to differentiate between circles and squares by pressing buttons while ignoring intervening English words. In the critical trials, the to-be-ignored words concealed a sound repetition with the words "circle" or "square" when translated into Chinese. In these trials, we found increased N200 event-related potential amplitudes, reflecting inhibition in this condition as compared to the control condition, in which the intervening words were totally unrelated to the shapes. Since no lateralised readiness potential effect was found in this comparison, access to Chinese translations must have been quickly inhibited, consistent with the fact that we observed no behavioural effects of the hidden manipulation. These results suggest fast and unconscious language nonselective access even when no language task is being performed.},

abstract = {Is reading for translation equal to reading in monolingual contexts? Horizontal/parallel theories of translation propose that normal reading and reading for translation differ because the translator engages in partial reformulation while reading for translating the source text. In contrast, vertical/serial theories assume that the translators first extract the meaning of the message, and only then they proceed to reformulate it. In two experiments, we manipulated lexical and syntactic properties of the target language (TL) while translators read for repetition or for translation. On-line sentence comprehension was affected by the lexical frequency of words in the TL (Experiment 1) and the syntactic congruency between the source language (SL) and TL sentences (Experiment 2). However, the influence of lexical and syntactic TL properties was restricted to the reading for translation task. According to our results, the horizontal view of translation includes code-to-code links between the SL and TL involving at least the lexical and syntactic level of processing.},

abstract = {This study explores how the process of translating relates to other types of writing processes by comparing pause lengths preceding syntactic units (words, phrases and clauses) in two types of writing task, a monolingual text production and a translation. It also discusses the grounds for interpreting pause length as a refl ection of the cognitive demands of the writing process. The data was collected from 18 professional translators using the Translog keystroke logging software (Jakobsen/Schou 1999). Each subject wrote two texts: an expository text in Finnish and a translation from English into Finnish (Immonen 2006: 316-319). Firstly, phrase boundary pauses were categorised according to type, function and length of phrase. All three features correlate with pause length. On average, predicate phrases are preceded by short pauses, adpositional phrases by long pauses, and pauses preceding noun phrases grow with the length of the phrase. These fi ndings suggest that the processing of the predicate begins before written production of the clause is started, whereas noun phrases and adpositional phrases are processed during writing. Secondly, pauses preceding clauses were categorised with respect to clause type. In monolingual text production, pauses preceding subordinate clauses are on average shorter than those leading to main clauses. In translation, pauses preceding subordinate and main clauses are almost the same length. It seems therefore that, in translation, the main clause and subordinate clause are processed separately despite the fact that the subordinate clause functions as a syntactic unit within the main clause.},

@article{Wu2013,
abstract = {Language non-selective lexical access in bilinguals has been established mainly using tasks requiring explicit language processing. Here, we show that bilinguals activate native language translations even when words presented in their second language are incidentally processed in a nonverbal, visual search task. Chinese-English bilinguals searched for strings of circles or squares presented together with three English words (i.e., distracters) within a 4-item grid. In the experimental trials, all four locations were occupied by English words, including a critical word that phonologically overlapped with the Chinese word for circle or square when translated into Chinese. The eye-tracking results show that, in the experimental trials, bilinguals looked more frequently and longer at critical than control words, a pattern that was absent in English monolingual controls. We conclude that incidental word processing activates lexical representations of both languages of bilinguals, even when the task does not require explicit language processing. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Defrancq2015,
abstract = {The aim of this study, based on 32 French speeches simultaneously interpreted into Dutch at plenary sessions of the European Parliament in late 2008, was to ascertain whether short ear-voice span (EVS) affects the quality of the interpretation as is commonly stated in the literature. The speeches and interpretations were taken from the 'EPIC Ghent' corpus, which is in preparation at Ghent University. Three phenomena were identified as potential effects of a short EVS: syntactic transcodage (maintaining the right-branching French 'noun+de+noun' structure, not using a more natural left-branching structure, in the Dutch interpretation), use of cognates similar in sound to source language forms ('glissement phon{\'{e}}tique'), and certain self-repairs (Barik 1973; Gile 1995). Time tags were applied to both the source and target texts, so that EVS could be measured to the nearest second from the onset of a source language item to the onset of the target language equivalent. The hypothesis was that EVS would be shorter in contexts where these three phenomena occur than elsewhere in the subcorpus. This was borne out in only one case, i.e. use of cognates: short (2 secs.) and very short (1 sec.) EVS was significantly more frequent in contexts where cognates occurred than elsewhere. There was no statistically significant frequency difference in the context of transcodage or of the relevant self-repairs.},
